/* Strategy Pattern â€“ What It Does
Strategy pattern reduce duplicate code, customize behaviours at run time . 
example : selecting functionaliy as per need, which can be used by object as it own capabliy.

1 Promotes composition over inheritance
2 Allows changing behavior dynamically
3 Makes the code more maintainable, flexible, and testable
